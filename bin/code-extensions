# This script is meant to keep VS Code's extensions in your dotfiles repo
# * To start using it, run `code-extensions snapshot`
# * To show the differences between the suggested extensions and the ones on your machine: `code-extensions show`
# * To bring your extensions up-to-date, run `code-extensions sync`
# * To set your current list of extensions as official, `code-extensions snapshot`

# Hope this script doesn't have a future: https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_43#_settings-sync
